            <p>
                
                Colombia is the 3rd largest economy in Latin America!
                48.5 million inhabitants, a growing middle class and a  young population make it 
                a really promising market:
                Almost 1/3 of private household consumption in Colombia goes into the food & 
                beverage sector and rising disposable incomes boost the demand further.                
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title">4. PROFIT FROM A GROWING HORECA SECTOR!</div>
            <p>
                
                Tourism is also growing fast, surpassing even coffee, flowers and bananas as a
                foreign income generator! Together with higher spending in restaurants and cafes, 
                the HORECA sector benefits heavily from the country’s positive development.
