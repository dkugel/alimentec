        <h1 class="display-3">THERE ARE MANY REASONS TO COME TO ALIMENTEC BOGOTÁ 2020 – HERE ARE SOME OF THE BEST:</h1>
        <p class="lead">1. PROFIT FROM A NO. 1 BASE!
            Alimentec is the leading trade fair for the food & drink as well as the hospitality
            industry in Colombia and the Andean region.  The most comprehensive buyer groups
            will be present, from Colombia as well as from Latin America and the Caribbean. 
            It is the leading platform for qualified business contacts and the perfect base 
            for your success in the region! Colombia is the perfect hub to expand your
            business in the fast-growing markets in the Andean region and Central America.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            2. PROFIT FROM POWERFUL PARTNERS!
            Alimentec is “powered by Anuga”, the world’s leading trade fair in food & beverage. 
            Corferias and Koelnmesse are the organisers – which means you will benefit from 
            the combined power of two strong players, their excellent know-how and their 
            widespread networks.                
        <!-- <a class="btn btn-warning btn-lg btn-md" href="widgets.html" role="button">Here is a button 2</a> -->
        </p>
        <p>
            3. PROFIT FROM A PROMISING MARKET!
            Colombia is the 3rd largest economy in Latin America!
            48.5 million inhabitants, a growing middle class and a  young population make it 
            a really promising market:
            Almost 1/3 of private household consumption in Colombia goes into the food & 
            beverage sector and rising disposable incomes boost the demand further.                
        </p>
        <p>
            4. PROFIT FROM A GROWING HORECA SECTOR!
            Tourism is also growing fast, surpassing even coffee, flowers and bananas as a
             foreign income generator! Together with higher spending in restaurants and cafes, 
             the HORECA sector benefits heavily from the country’s positive development.
